# Title of amazing article

*Every Inbox article has an introdution section before the real article starts. This should be a short piece of text providing an overview of what the article will be about. It is also possible to have a header image for your article, but this is not mandatory.*

Please use paragraphs to make your article or turorial easy to digest. Paragraphs help tremendously with reader comprehension and ensuring there is a good flow to your article. It is also possible to use titles above your paragraphs, but preferable dont do this on your first one, simply because it looks funny. As always, see current articles in the [Eonics Inbox](https://eonics.nl/inbox) for plenty of examples of how your article will look when the magic Inbox sauce will have been applied.

## Paragraph title

So now I used a paragraph title, and in the previous paragraph you saw me using a link. Another very cool thing that the Inbox supports is syntax highlighting and code blocks! However, try to keep the code blocks as compact as possible considering the context of your article or tutorial, simply because it makes the article look better on all devices and easier to digest for the more casual readers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   // way back in my university days I used to be able to code in c...
   printf("Hello, Eonics!");
   return 0;
}
```

So as you can see your markdown can be replicated pretty much 1-1 to an Inbox article, isn't that amazing?! Even better: you don't have to worry about converting it, simply write your article or tutorial in markdown, send it to me, and I will do the rest. By the way; if you are unsure about your writing skills don't worry, a dedicated team is here to do polishing, images and whatever is necessary to turn your piece into a snazzy piece fit for publication. 

## To summarize

The Inbox writers and editors lack technical knowledge to go deep on tech, so we would really appreciate our colleagaues with technical knowledge to come up with cool and interesting article's and tutorials abou technical subjects, anything goes! It does not have to be long, but it can be, just do whatever feels right to you and we will make it work once you send us the raw material. To close I want to include an image just to make the template complete.

In the Eonics Inbox you can even use captions for images, but this is not supported on github I think, but just so you know. This concludes this template, please copy and use it as you see fit to start working on your very own inbox article!
